    This project focuses on developing a multi-client server communication system using socket programming.
The server is designed to handle multiple clients concurrently, allowing three clients to connect and send messages simultaneously. 
Multi-threading is implemented to ensure efficient handling of client connections without blocking communication. 
The system demonstrates real-time message exchange between clients and the server, highlighting key networking concepts such as 
socket connections, data transmission, and concurrent processing. This implementation can be applied to various real-world applications 
requiring real-time client-server interaction
